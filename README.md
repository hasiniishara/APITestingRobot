API Testing with Robot Framework
This project demonstrates API integration and validation using Robot Framework. It leverages built-in Robot Framework libraries for efficient and scalable API testing with minimal coding.

Features
API Testing: Validates RESTful APIs by making HTTP requests and verifying JSON/XML responses.
Keyword-Driven: Utilizes Robot Framework's keyword-driven approach to simplify test case writing.
Scalability: Easy to extend with more test cases and functionalities.
Libraries Used
Requests Library: For making HTTP requests to API endpoints.
JSON Library: For validating and parsing JSON responses(Future)
XML Library: For handling XML responses(Future)
Collections Library: For working with lists, dictionaries, and other collections.
